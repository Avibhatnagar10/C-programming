When we declare a variable, we should also specify what type of variable it is. This is known as data type, basically meaning what type of data we are going to store in a variable.

Here are some of the major data types and what they store in C:

Data Type	Description	Range(of values they can store)

int--	Stores integers	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long-- Stores large integers	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float--	Stores decimal numbers	1.2e-38 to 3.4e38
double--	Stores large decimal numbers	2.3e-308 to 1.7e308
char--	Stores single character	-128 to 127
bool--	Stores true or false	true or false


To print a double, we do:

printf("%f", radius);
Note that to print a double, we are using %f instead of %d. If you use %d to print a double value, the output will be very different.
