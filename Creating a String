Strings are used for storing text.

A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes. Strings are implemented as character arrays in C.

For example:

char greet[] = "Hello";
greet is a variable of type string and contains the value Hello.

To print a string, we use another format specifier, %s.
