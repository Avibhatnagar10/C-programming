Here's a table of common operators used in C conditions:

Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to	a == b
!=	Not equal to	a != b
>	Greater than	a > b
<	Less than	a < b
>=	Greater than or equal to	a >= b
<=	Less than or equal to	a <= b

------------------------------------

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int age = 25;
    int voting_age = 18;
      if (age >= voting_age) {
        printf("Old enough to vote!");
    } else {
        printf("Not old enough to vote.");
    }
}
