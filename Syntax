#include <stdio.h>: This line is including the Standard Input Output header file. In simple terms, it tells the compiler to include a set of standard input/output functions (like printf) that you can use in your program.
int main() { ... }: This is the main function of your C program. Every C program starts executing from the main function. It's the entry point. The int before main indicates that this function will return an integer value. In short, when the main function in a C program returns a value (either 0 for success or a non-zero value for failure), it returns this value to the operating system. The operating system can then use this return value for error checking, automation, or other purposes.
